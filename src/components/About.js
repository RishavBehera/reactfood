                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br/> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br/>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br/>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
